### 1.Conputer

A computer is a device that can be instructed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations automatically via computer programming.

### 2.Computer science

Computer science is the study of the theory, experimentation, and engineering that form the basis for the design and use of computers. 

### 3.Software

Computer software, or simply software, is a generic term that refers to a collection of data or computer instructions that tell the computer how to work, in contrast to the physical hardware from which the system is built, that actually performs the work. 

### 4.Software engineering

Software engineering is the application of engineering to the development of software in a systematic method.

### 5.Alan Turing

Alan Mathison Turing OBE FRS (/ˈtjʊərɪŋ/; 23 June 1912 – 7 June 1954) was an English computer scientist, mathematician, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher, and theoretical biologist.[2] Turing was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science, providing a formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine, which can be considered a model of a general purpose computer.[7][8][9] Turing is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence.

### 6.Moore's law

Moore's law is the observation that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit doubles about every two years.
