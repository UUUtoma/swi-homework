### 1.Conputer

A computer is a device that can be instructed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations automatically via computer programming.

电子计算机是一种利用数字电子技术，根据一系列指令指示其自动执行任意算术或逻辑操作串行的设备。

### 2.Computer science

Computer science is the study of the theory, experimentation, and engineering that form the basis for the design and use of computers. 

计算机科学是对理论、实验和工程的研究，他们构成了设计和使用计算机的基础。
### 3.Software

Computer software, or simply software, is a generic term that refers to a collection of data or computer instructions that tell the computer how to work, in contrast to the physical hardware from which the system is built, that actually performs the work. 

计算机软件或其简称软件是一个通用术语，指的是告诉计算机如何工作的数据或计算机指令集合，与构建系统的物理硬件相比，软件执行工作。



### 4.Software engineering

Software engineering is the application of engineering to the development of software in a systematic method.

软件工程是以系统方法开发软件的应用工程。

### 5.Alan Turing

Alan Mathison Turing OBE FRS (/ˈtjʊərɪŋ/; 23 June 1912 – 7 June 1954) was an English computer scientist, mathematician, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher, and theoretical biologist. Turing was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science, providing a formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine, which can be considered a model of a general purpose computer. Turing is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence.

艾伦图灵是一名英国计算机科学家，数学家，逻辑学家，密码分析学家，哲学家，理论生物学家。图灵在计算机理论科学的发展进程中有着重大贡献：他提供的概念形式化算法和计算与图灵机，被认为是一个通用模型计算机。图灵被公认为理论计算机科学和人工智能之父。

### 6.Moore's law

Moore's law is the observation that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit doubles about every two years. 

摩尔定律是指集成电路上可容纳的电晶体（晶体管）数目，约每隔两年便会增加一倍。
